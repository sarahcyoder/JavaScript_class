# JavaScript Class

This repository contains code from assignments and projects in my Web Programming with JavaScript class at UC Davis Extension. Each assignment includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a pseudo code file. The pseudo code does not always exactly match the end product, as I created those before starting to code and sometimes thought of better ways to complete the project. However, I kept them because they provide an explanation of my logic in prose.

## Projects

- sarahyoder-finalproject: For this project, I was instructed to create a stopwatch/countdown clock. It is the most in-depth project of the course, with the most code. I gained a strong understanding of global vs local variables, and it required very logical, organized code. Concepts included are regular expressions, the DOM, if statements, intervals, and debug modes. You can view my pseudo code document to see a prose version of my logic.

- sarahyoder-L5: In this assignment, the user inputs a number from 1 to 999, and the computer has the guess what the number is within 10 guesses. You'll see my original pseudo code for when I tried to figure it out before actually coding, but the actual product is much better than what I originally designed. I ended up starting with a random guess, and then allowing the computer to loop 9 times, using previous guesses to inform the next guess, based on whether the previous guess was too high or too low and setting new upper and lower bounds accordingly.

- sarahyoder-L6:  This code determines if an input value is a palindrome. I did this by using a loop to reverse the input value, and then testing whether the result of that loop matched the initial input value.

- sarahyoder-L9: This code shows form processing and validation using regular expressions.
